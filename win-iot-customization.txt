GOAL: To make a custom version of NOOBS that will provide a way to create a factory restore feature for customized Windoes 10 IoT images.

I used:

1. Notepad++ or other editor that can maintain the unix line endings.
2. WinRAR or some other archiver program capable of extracting *.tar.xz files.
3. SD Association's Formatting Tool from "https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/eula_windows/".

Here's what I discovered:

1. When examining NOOBS full release with a local distribution of Raspbian against NOOBS_Lite and it's downloading and installation of Raspbian, I see that  NOOBS downloads a JSON file http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/os_list_v3.json and uses that to augment the os.json files in any folders under the ./os/ folder.
2. So, it appeares the thing to do is manually download and save those files for Windows 10 IoT and make a few changes to use the local image.

Here's what I did:

1. I downloaded NOOBS from raspberrypi.org and prepared it according to it's instructions.
2. I got the list of operating systems from "http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/os_list_v3.json". I found the Windows IoT section. It begins with "os_name": "Windows 10 IoT Core".
3. I downloaded the files indicated for: icon, marketting_info, os_info, partitions_info, partition_setup and tarballs and copied them into "SDCARD:\os\win10iotcustom\".
4. I created a folder "SDCARD:\os\win10iotcustom\" and copied the downloaded files into that folder.
5. I edited the "SDCARD:\os\win10iotcustom\os.json" file to change it's the name field from "Windows 10 IoT Core" to "Windows 10 IoT Core (custom)" so that it will be differentiated in case NOOBS downloads the full list of OS's.
6. I downloaded the latest release version of Windows 10 IoT Core ISO. I renamed it to "IOT Core RPi.ISO" and copied it to the os folder.
7. I edited the "partition_setup.sh" file I changed to IMAGE="/mnt/os/win10iotcustom/IOT Core RPi.ISO" because we aren't going to download it.
8. In the if..fi section that refers to DEBUG and InstallationPrecheck. I added '#' characters to the beginning of all those lines to comment them out. That section brings up a loader that asks you to download the release or insider version. We will not be downloading anything.
9. The next if..fi section downloads the version selected. You will see a comment about downloading the ISO and a "wget" command. I commented out all of this section too.
10. I opened all json and sh files and resaved them with unit line endings.
11. I prepared an SD card according the steps in the regular NOOBS distro.

NOTE: I copied the modified *.sh and *.json files into this repo in the ./sdcontent/ folder.

TO DO:

It would be great if this used the flash.ffu file. It appears from the debug code near the beginning of partition_setup.sh that it could be possible since it referes to a debug option of flash.7z. I'll have to try that next.

NOOBS itself needs to be modified to not attempt to download the os jason file if it happens to be connected to the internet.

Maybe add some customizations so that NOOBS will display an OEM logo.
